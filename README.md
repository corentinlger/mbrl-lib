# Planning for next experiments

### Code:
- Try to use efficient kan instead of kan
    - implement it on kanrl, compare mlp, kan & efficient kan (Corentin)
- Implement Kans for models inside of mbrllib
    - keep option for MLP to easily benchmark both
    - TOOD: see other intermediate steps
    - Launch some initial experiments to get feedback and see next steps
- try kans with different algorithms ?
    - possibly benchmark them w more algos, such as SAC ...
    - possibly replace some algo parts w kans & others with mlps (e.g actor kan, critic mlp)

let's see what we priorize

 ### Paper:
 - will depend a lot on initial experiments
